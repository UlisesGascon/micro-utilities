```

**Usage**

```js
const user = {
  name: "Jane",
  nickname: "JaneDoe",
  isAdmin: true,
  age: 120,
  bio: "Hacker life",
};
// Just create a copy with less stuff
const simpleUser = simplifyObject(user, {
  exclude: ["name", "bio", "age"],
});
console.log(simpleUser);

// Just create a copy with specific things
const simpleUser2 = simplifyObject(user, {
  include: ["name", "bio", "age"],
});
console.log(simpleUser2); //  {name: "Jane",bio: "Hacker life", age: 120 }
